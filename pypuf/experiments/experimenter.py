"""
This module provides a class which acts as process pool. The is build in order to distribute several experiments over
the system cores. The results of the experiments are written into on a single log file which is coordinated by a logging
process. In order to run experiments a path to a logfile and list of experiments is needed which inherit the
pypuf.experiments.experiment.base class.

Example usage:

experiments = []
n = 128
for i in range(n):
    log_name = 'test_multiprocessing_logs{0}'.format(i)
    experiment = Experiment(...)
    experiments.append(experiment)
